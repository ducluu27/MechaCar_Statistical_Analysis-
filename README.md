## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are the vehicle weights. Since the multiple R-squared is .7149 and the p-value is 5.35e-11, the slope of our linear model is zero. Since our R value is greater than our p-value. Therefore, we can fail to reject our null hypthesis. The linear model does predict our mpg of MechaCar protytpes effectively because
